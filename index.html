	<h1>Welcome to Tables!</h1>
	<div>
<!-- If you wish to add a border to an HTML element, just add border="1" to the table element -->
		<p>In most websites, there are tables that are used to display information and this is the case because they are capable of presenting data and info very eficiently. Before actually inserting the data, we must naturally create the table first by using the Table element. Similar to HTML's body element, the table element will contain all of the information.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Getting To Know the Basics!</h2>
<!-- Td, Th, and Tr, are the basis for all of the Tables. -->		
		<p>First off, to insert elements, we're going to need tables and rows to do such, and the Table Row element (tr) will do just that. If you wish to add data, you must use td, or Table Data. If you would like to addtitles to your rows and columns in your table, use the th element. The Row Value makes it clear that a title goes with a specific row. The col value makes it clear that a certain title goes with a specific column. Using the colspan attribute, one can spread something across multiple columns. It is possible to make borders on a graph using CSS, which can achieve a very similar effect to the now discontinued Border attribute. When the content within tables begins to grow, they will become noticeably long but the tbody element can section off these long tables. Note: All of your info must be contained within this element. The rowspan element is one that is used for information that spans mutiple rows in a graph. The thead element is used to section off the headings. The tfoot element can be used to section off the bottom of a graph.</p>

		<h3>Styling with CSS</h3>
<!-- Just like everything else, CSS will spice everything up, including tables -->		
		<p>By nature, tables are typically boring, bland, and an overall disaster, just like contemporary art. Unlike art though, HTML tables have a way to look good by getting a makeover with CSS. With CSS, you can change and alter the font size, colour, add borders, and control their sizes too.</p><img src="https://img.webnots.com/2013/12/HTML-Table-Structure.png">
